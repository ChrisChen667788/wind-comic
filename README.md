## ✨ Why Wind Comic?

Most "AI video" tools give you a 5-second clip from a one-line prompt. Wind Comic gives you a **finished short-form drama** — script, character bible, storyboards, voice-acted shots, BGM, and a final composition — from the same one line.

It works because it doesn't try to be one giant model. It's a **honest multi-agent pipeline**, where each role (Writer, Director, Producer, Designer, Editor) is a specialist that hands off to the next, with strict consistency contracts in between.

## 🏃 Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChrisChen667788/wind-comic.git
cd wind-comic

npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# fill in at minimum: OPENAI_API_KEY + MINIMAX_API_KEY

npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

That's it. The first run will create a local SQLite DB at `data/qfmj.db` and seed a demo account.

### Cheapest viable config

You only need **two** keys to get a working pipeline:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — any OpenAI-compatible (OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, [vectorengine.ai](https://vectorengine.ai), [openrouter](https://openrouter.ai))
- `MINIMAX_API_KEY` — image + video + TTS in one provider, ~¥0.15/sec

### Cinematic config (recommended)

Add these for noticeably better output quality:

- `MJ_API_KEY` (via aggregator) — Midjourney for storyboards · best character/scene refs
- `QINGYUNTOP_API_KEY` — Sora-2 / Veo-3.1 fallback for the final cinematic shots
- `FAL_KEY` — FLUX Kontext for state-of-the-art reference-image consistency

See [.env.example](.env.example) for the full list with inline docs.

## 🧠 How it actually works

Wind Comic is built on a few ideas that — separately — are obvious, and together — surprisingly few projects do well.

### 1. Each agent has one job and a strict output contract

The Writer doesn't generate images. The Designer doesn't write dialogue. The Editor doesn't think about character consistency. Every handoff is a typed JSON contract you can inspect in `types/` and the orchestrator (`services/hybrid-orchestrator.ts`) is essentially a well-typed router between them.

### 2. Consistency is enforced by *measurement*, not by *prompting harder*

Most pipelines tell the model "draw the same character" and hope. Wind Comic's `Cameo Vision Auto-Retry` actually scores each generated shot against the canonical reference using GPT-4o Vision. If the score is below 75, the orchestrator regenerates with a `cw` boost (`100 → 125`) and an extra `--cref`. If the second attempt is *worse* than the first, it rolls back. There's a real feedback loop, with telemetry.

### 3. Provider abstraction is real, not aspirational

Every model is behind a service module (`services/openai.service.ts`, `services/minimax.service.ts`, `services/midjourney.service.ts`, `services/veo.service.ts`, ...) with a normalized signature. Want to swap MiniMax for Vidu? Edit the router. Want to plug in your local ComfyUI? Set `COMFYUI_ENABLED=true`. Want to use the open-source [XVERSE-Ent](https://github.com/xverse-ai/XVERSE-Ent) MoE screenwriter instead of Claude? Set `XVERSE_ENABLED=true`. Done.

### 4. Polish Studio Pro is its own application

Most "AI video" tools treat the script as a prompt. Wind Comic treats it as a first-class artifact: it has its own `Polish Studio` page (`/dashboard/polish`) with a Robert McKee–framed audit card, 10-version history, LCS-diff panel, and one-click Word export. Use it standalone if you don't care about video.

## 📦 Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables — no config file dance, no UI-driven secrets.

The full annotated list is in [.env.example](.env.example). Three quick highlights:

- **Provider URLs are user-overridable.** Default `OPENAI_BASE_URL` is `https://api.openai.com/v1`, but every aggregator that speaks the OpenAI protocol works (vectorengine.ai, openrouter, your own deployment). Same pattern for `MJ_BASE_URL`, `MINIMAX_BASE_URL`, `VEO_BASE_URL`.
- **You can self-host the writer.** Set `XVERSE_ENABLED=true` and point `XVERSE_BASE_URL` at your vLLM/sglang server running [XVERSE-Ent](https://github.com/xverse-ai/XVERSE-Ent). Wind Comic will use it for the Writer agent and fall back to Claude/GPT only when XVERSE errors out.
- **You can run without GPU spend.** Stand up a local ComfyUI, set `COMFYUI_ENABLED=true`, and the image router will prefer it over paid providers.

## 🤝 Contributing

PRs welcome. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup, project structure, and the PR checklist. Issues tagged `good first issue` are scoped to ~half a day for a developer new to the codebase.

If you want to add a new AI provider, follow the pattern in `services/` — each provider is one file, ~150 lines, with a normalized async signature.
